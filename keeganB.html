	<h3 style="text-align: right">Education</h3>
	<p>
	Bachelors of Science - Computer Science <br>	<!-- This is the education section !-->
	Eastern Michigan University, 2022 <br><br>
	Believe it or not, I am the best student to ever attend school at EMU. I have gotten a 5.0 every semester
	since my freshman semester. I have had my portrait drawn for this achievement and they even plan to rename
	a building after my legacy sometime in the next 5 years. Of course when I am the most famous programmer
	in the workforce, after graduation, they will receive tons of money from all my sponsors. It is MOST impressive.

	<h3 style="text-align: right">Computer Skills</h3>
	<p>
	These are my computer skills, I am very skilled. </p> <!-- This is the computer/technology skill section !-->
	<ul>
		<li>Typing</li>
		<li>Browsing</li>
		<li>Programming</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	I am one of the fastest typists known to man, infact, so I do advertise it as a skill for myself. I can type
	up to 1,000 WPM (word per minute) on a good day, but usually average about 700 WPM. I've won numerous
	compeitions for this achievement and wear it as a badge of honor. <br><br>
	I am also a proficient browser. You ask me to open the internet and browse, and I can do it better than anyone
	else. In high school I earned multiple awards, and even a medal, for this skill and have been proud to be
	nominated as my regions best browser. <br><br>
	I am also the world's best programmer. I was born with a keyboard under my hands and have been programming ever
	since. And if you read above about my impressive typing abilities, you'll understand that my ability to type
	with insane speed, also leads me to be able to program faster than any other known human. This has also won me
	numerous awards that make me the BEST.

	<h3 style="text-align: right">Courses</h3> <!-- This is the course section !-->
	<p>
	Look at all the courses I'm enrolled in. I decided to take three COSC courses again this semester so that I may
	continue to make significant progress in my degree. I almost took a fourth, but I thought a fourth intense COSC
	course might be too much for me in one semester. I also have several others commitments each week and 16 credit
	hours of these courses would probably be outside of reasonable for me. Overall, these courses have been great so
	far and I've been glad to be taking them. I have already learned so much from each of them, and it is only the
	third week of courses. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>COSC 436 - Web Programming</li>
		<li>COSC 423 - Operating Systems</li>
		<li>COSC 374 - Applied Cryptography</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 style="text-align: right">Projects</h3>		<!-- This is the project section !-->
	<p>
	Each of these projects has either been a passion project, or the result of a course-long project.
	All of these projects were created solely by me during the 2020-2021 Academic Year. 
	They are organized in a list from most to least intensive. 
	My personal favorite is the Java-based Music Baker. This project took me approximately 
	20 hours and was completed in less than three weeks.
	I learned a significant amount about many data structures during this project.
	The Minecraft Mods are an ongoing project created with the Forge API for the Java edition of Minecraft.
	I decided to create a Minecraft mod
	because of my own personal interest in the game. I've been playing Minecraft for 10 years now,
	and decided it was time to learn to modify the game
	Art in Code was an experimental interpretation of code by an AI that processes 
	code as color and sound. I created a website to host this data
	so that others may enjoy the sounds and sights of different code across 5 different languages.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Technology Internship</li>
			<li>Teacher's Assistant for 3 Courses'</li>		<!-- This is the job section !-->
			<li>5 Retail positions from 2016-2021</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		Each of these positions has taught me numerous invaluable life lessons. I wouldn't replace the experience I
		gained from them for anything in the world. My most favorite retail postion was working at the store. That store
		was the most amazing one in town. We specialized in the most niche of technologies. Only the super elite, such
		as Jeff Bezoz, would come into our establishment as no one else was able to handle the niche of our store.<br><br>
		The technology internship was by far the most educational for my career. I learned information, that I already knew,
		but in a new light that taught me so much about my plans for my future career. This position was before I had
		begun attending EMU (as their best student of all time), but it was still extremely influential in my decision to
		attend with the Computer Science Major.

			<li>There are a lot of people on Earth</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		Each of the above listed items perfectly represents my sense of character and I want to publicly advertise these
		aspects of myself on this resume site. I think they are extremely important to be known before I am hired by any
		future employers. If you are unable to understand these niche facts about myself and the world, I will not be
		compatible with your workplace or you as an employer. Thank you for understanding in these difficult times.
